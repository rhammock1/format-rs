# Format in Rust

Prints file contents to the terminal. Printed content can optionally be formatted based on Markdown or other supported formatting styles.

## Goal
I write notes from my terminal and would like to print my notes to the terminal screen with highlighting, strikethroughs, etc.


## Testing
The README will also be used as a testing document

~This text should be strikethrough~
`This text should be highlighted`
_This text should be STRONG_
*This text should be italicized*
Numbers- 1234 should be colored
"Double Quoted strings will be another color"
'Single Quote will be another'
